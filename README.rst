django-u2f provides support for FIDO U2F security tokens in Django. The
functionality is similar to the `Security Key two-factor authentication that
Google recently announced
<http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/10/strengthening-2-step-verification-with.html>`_,
and uses the same tokens.

django-u2f isn't yet production ready, but is a working proof of
concept. There are many TODOs sprinkled around the code that should be
fixed before relying on it.

Installation
============

::

    $ pip install django-u2f

Add ``django_u2f`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and include
``django_u2f.urls`` somewhere in your url patterns. Set ``LOGIN_URL
= 'u2f:login'``. Make sure that Django's built in login
view does not not have a urlpattern, because it will authenticate users
without their second factor. django-u2f provides its own login view to
handle that.

Demo
====

To see a demo, use the test project included in the repo and perform the 
following steps (using virtualenv is optional)::

   git clone https://github.com/gavinwahl/django-u2f
   cd django-u2f
   virtualenv -p python3 venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .
   cd testproj
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser

   # finally create a self-signed certificate and start the webserver
   ./mkcert.sh  
   python manage.py runserver_plus --cert localhost

For now the only supported browser is Chrome, version 41 or higher.
U2F also requires that the page is served over a secure connection.


Start by going to https://localhost:8000/u2f/login. Since you
haven't added any security keys yet, you will be logged in with just a
username and password. Once logged in, click 'Add another key' on the
key management page and follow the instructions. Now your account is
protected by two factor authentication, and when you log in again your
U2F token will be required.

You can administrate the keys attached to your account on the key
management page as well, at the URL https://localhost:8000/u2f/keys.

Using U2F keys on linux
=======================

Some distros don't come with udev rules to make USB HID /dev/
nodes accessible to normal users. If your key doesn't light up
and start flashing when you expect it to, this might be what is
happening. See https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/issues/2 and
https://github.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/blob/master/70-u2f.rules for some
discussion of the rule to make it accessible. If you just want a quick
temporary fix, you can run ``sudo chmod 666 /dev/hidraw*`` every time
after you plug in your key (The files disappear after unplugging).
